<p><i>Lorem Ipsum este pur şi simplu o machetă pentru text a industriei tipografice. 
Lorem Ipsum a fost macheta standard a industriei încă din secolul al XVI-lea, 
când un tipograf anonim a luat o planşetă de litere şi le-a amestecat pentru a crea o 
carte demonstrativă pentru literele respective. Nu doar că a supravieţuit timp de cinci secole, 
dar şi a facut saltul în tipografia electronică practic neschimbată. 
A fost popularizată în anii '60 odată cu ieşirea colilor Letraset care conţineau pasaje Lorem Ipsum, 
iar mai recent, prin programele de publicare pentru calculator, ca Aldus PageMaker care includeau 
versiuni de Lorem Ipsum.</i></p>

<p>As alarming as it sounds, the ozone hole over Antarctica has reached its largest and deepest form yet, 
compared to previous years, according to the report by the European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring 
Service (CAMS).The forming of the ozone hole, which was first observed around the 1970s, is a phenomenon 
caused by ozone depletion due to climate change. It annually takes place over Antarctica and appears in 
September and October, following the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
Researchers have been closely studying its size year by year.</p>

<h2 class = "stil" align="center">Banders Discover Rare Bird With Both Male and Female Characteristics</h2>
<p>Researchers at Powdermill Nature Reserve, Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s environmental research center 
in Rector, PA, found the rare Rose-breasted Grosbeak gynandromorph and took pictures for all to see. The bird 
is quite a beauty displaying all kinds of colors on its plumage (both female and male) and furthermore, it is 
also perfectly healthy.More specifically, it displays the male colorings on the right side and the female ones 
on the left. “The entire banding team was very excited to see such a rarity up close, and are riding the high 
of this once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said Annie Lindsay, bird banding program manager at Powdermill.</p>

<h2 class = "stil" align="center">5 Cent-Sensor Detects COVID and Immunity in 10 Minutes</h2>
<p>What makes COVID-19 so elusive is that some people who have it don't even have the slightest clue. There are 
thousands of asymptomatic people out there going about their businesses at any given time. It's easy to let your 
guard down and help its spread. Testing is a viable way to overcome, or at least, curb this problem. But the 
currently available test results aren't so viable as they're costly and take days to give off results.
A new device developed at Caltech called SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex could run to our aid with that. It's basically 
an at-home test kit with a sensor and Bluetooth. When its smeared with blood or alive it determines if the sample 
giver has or had COVID in just 10 minutes. In a way, it's sort of like a crossover of at-home blood glucose test 
kits and pregnancy tests. It resembles the former in the sense that it can be used multiple times and the latter 
in the sense that it works via a drop on its sensor parts.</p>
